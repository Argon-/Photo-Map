Project for working with OpenStreetMap data.
Displays photos with embedded GPS information on a map, provides path
and route finding capabilities.

This is an Eclipse project, so usage is probably straight forward.

Please note: this is not intended to be polished end-user software but
merely a proof-of-concept thing. Nevertheless, it's perfectly usable.
Also please bear in mind certain parts were explicitly written with
performance in mind, sacrificing some other ideals.
