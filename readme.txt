Project for working with OpenStreetMap data.
This is an Eclipse project, so usage is probably straight forward.

Please note: this is not intended to be polished end-user software but
merely a proof-of-concept thing. Nevertheless, it's perfectly usable.
Also please bear in mind certain parts were explicity written with
performance in mind, sacrificing some other ideals.
